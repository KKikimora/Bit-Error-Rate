# Bit-Error-Rate
This console program calculates the BER (Bit Error Rate) for any two files.
It takes two arguments - the paths of two files, for which it calculates the BER.
The result of the program's work is:
- number of compared bits
- number of different bits
- BER result
- calculation time
Additionally, the program generates a log.txt file, where are saved logs describing the program's flow.
